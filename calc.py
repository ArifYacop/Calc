Program: Simple Calculator 
Author: Anas Tawalbeh
Simple calcuatro help the user calculate the basic 4 operations including:
addition, subtraction, multiplication and division
Significant constants
         there is no constants
 2. The inputs are
         2 numbers (at least)
 3. Computations:
         addition: number + another number
         subtraction: number - another number
         multiplication: number * another number
         division: number / another number
 4. The outputs are
         computation result
